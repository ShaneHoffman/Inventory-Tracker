# Inventory Tracker (Work In Progress)

This project was started because I wanted to do some work on websites. I resell sneakers and other retail items so
making an inventory tracker for this work seemed like an obvious choice.

Currently only part of the backend is complete. I have setup a few rest API's for the simple creation of users and
inventory items. I have added functionality for adding, deleting, editing, and viewing these objects within a database.

The backend uses Express, Node JS and Mongoose.

# TO-DO
  - Finish backend
  - Start working on a frontend to view the inventory and make changes on a website
